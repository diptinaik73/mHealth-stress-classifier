# Multimodal Sensor Analysis: MHEALTH Project

This project uses ECG and IMU data from the MHEALTH dataset to simulate multimodal sensor fusion for activity classification and stress-state inference. It demonstrates signal processing, feature extraction, and basic machine learning techniques using real-world data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Highlights
- Preprocessing and syncing ECG and IMU signals
- Feature extraction from time-series data
- Classification of activity states using Random Forest
- Interpretation of ECG changes to simulate stress conditions
